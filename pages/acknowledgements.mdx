The completion of this project would not have been possible without the help and support of many people and institutions. First, we want to sincerely thank our project guide, Professor Ishan K Rajani, for their guidance, expertise, and constant encouragement throughout the project. Their patience, advice, and willingness to share knowledge helped us greatly in shaping the project and overcoming challenges. We would like to thank our CSE department, especially Dr. Kruti Sutaria and Professor Yatin Shukla, for their valuable input, feedback, and assistance during the various stages of the project. Their expertise enriched our understanding.

Furthermore, we are grateful to the open-source community and the developers behind the technologies we utilized, such as eBPF, OCSF, and various AI/ML libraries. Their contributions have been instrumental in enabling our research and pushing the boundaries of cybersecurity innovation. We also appreciate our fellow students who contributed their time, efforts and ideas during our group discussions and collaborations. Their different perspectives helped improve our work. Finally, we are grateful to our families and friends for their unconditional love, support and motivation that gave us strength during this challenging journey. Their belief in us was vital. This project would not have succeeded without the collective efforts of all these people and institutions. We deeply appreciate their invaluable contributions.
