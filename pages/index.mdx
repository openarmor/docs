### Why use OpenArmor?

With OpenArmor, you can perform the following use cases:

- Fast, scalable full-text search
- Application and infrastructure monitoring
- Security and event information management
- Operational health tracking

Help users find the right information within your application, website, or data lake catalog. Easily store and analyze log data, and set automated alerts for underperformance. Centralize logs to enable real-time security monitoring and forensic analysis. Use observability logs, metrics, and traces to monitor your applications and business in real time.

### Additional features and plugins:

OpenArmor has several features and plugins to help index, secure, monitor, and analyze your data. Most OpenArmor plugins have corresponding OpenArmor Dashboards plugins that provide a convenient, unified user interface.

- Anomaly detection: Identify atypical data and receive automatic notifications
- KNN: Find “nearest neighbors” in your vector data
- Performance Analyzer: Monitor and optimize your cluster
- SQL: Use SQL or a piped processing language to query your data
- Index State Management: Automate index operations
- ML Commons plugin: Train and execute machine-learning models
- Asynchronous search: Run search requests in the background
- Cross-cluster replication: Replicate your data across multiple OpenArmor clusters

### The secure path forward

OpenArmor includes a demo configuration so that you can get up and running quickly, but before using OpenArmor in a production environment, you must configure the Security plugin manually with your own certificates, authentication method, users, and passwords.
